# Split the Difference

A simple cost-sharing app meant for mobile. Keep running tabs with your friends and know at a glance who's turn it is to pay for the next round.

Use running tabs to keep track of a group's shared spending. Whether it's your coworkers' daily coffee runs or your weekly trips to the bar with friends, you'll know at a glance whose turn it is to pay.

## What does this do?
- Create "Tabs" for different groups of people.
- Add group purchases to your Tab. After the first one, the app will show you who owes the group and how much they owe for next time.
- When adding a purchase, press "autofill" to fill in the details from your last outing.
- See a recent history of up to the last three purchases; who paid, when, and how much?
- Data stored entirely local to your device. No account or user info required!

## What doesn't this do?
This is currently an MVP, but more exciting features could be added in the future, such as:
- Delete/Archive Tabs
- Edit Tab members

Further afield, this app could be expanded to track the same people across different Tabs, or store your data in the cloud so you have it on all your devices. Even better, you could share a tab with other users!

## How'd you make this?
I used the marvelously free, open-source Godot game engine. Everything was made by me, excluding fonts [shoutout to the Mozilla Foundation at 1001fonts.org](https://www.1001fonts.com/fira-sans-font.html).

## How can I give this a try?
While this is designed for mobile use, getting an app on the Apple Store takes some time! In the meantime, you can download and run this on Windows by checking out the latest release.

If you want a better look at the internals, it's trivial to download the latest version of [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and see for yourself. Run it from the editor, tinker with it, it's yours to do with what you will.

Builds for iOS and macOS soon to follow.
